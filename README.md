How do I approach designing software?
  My design approach involves breaking down a complex goal, into simple acheiveable components. I begin with a high level concept an begin to build my foundation. I had learned how to design in a 3d coordinate system and created a resuable material system that made my project more scalable. I began my design process into basic shapes, built the geometry, and then added textures and lighting to make the scene more real. These tactics in my approach to designing this project, is directly applicable to every project I do from here on out, espeically in any data visualization or game desgin projects I work on.

How do I approach developing programs? 
  I learned how to visually debug problems that are based on the rendered output of the code. Each Iteration allowed me to adjust the way things lined up visually, allowing me to see my changes I have made, this allowed me to continiously make small changes to lighting, object positioning, and material properties.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  This project allowed me to refine my development process and break down large problems, into smaller manageable ones. This will benefit me on my educational journey and is applicable to the rest of my courses at SNHU. It also gives me skills that are directly applicable to things like game development, data visualization, cad software, and any other powerful visual based job.
